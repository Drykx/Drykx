## 👋 About Me

I'm passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on **reinforcement learning** and **natural language processing**. My research interests center on improving the **robustness** and **generalization** of modern models as a step toward human-level reasoning.

Beyond theory, I aim to build intelligent systems that **assist people meaningfully** and **benefit society**.

I have a strong background in **pure and applied mathematics**, particularly in:

- Probability & statistics  
- Stochastic processes  
- Measure theory & functional analysis
